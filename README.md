### PDF Extraction & Deep Learning Lecture Presentation Generator
## Overview
This project provides an automated pipeline for two main processes:

# PDF Extraction to DOCX Conversion:
Extracts text, images, and tables from a PDF document and converts the content into a well-formatted Microsoft Word (.docx) file.

# Automated Deep Learning Lecture Presentation Generation:
Summarizes the extracted content into a 10-minute lecture transcript on Deep Learning topics and generates a PowerPoint (.pptx) presentation organized into five sections:

Introduction

Literature Review

Methodology

Results and Discussion

Conclusion

This system is designed for academic and research purposes, streamlining the creation of educational materials and presentations with rigor and clarity.

# Features
PDF Content Extraction:

Extracts text with minimal formatting loss.

Captures embedded images and preserves quality.

Detects and converts tables into structured data for insertion into DOCX files.

DOCX Conversion:

Formats extracted content into a DOCX document.

Preserves document structure (headings, paragraphs, tables, images) for easy post-processing and editing.

Lecture Summarization & PPTX Generation:

Automatically analyzes the extracted content to produce a concise, 10-minute lecture transcript on Deep Learning.

Organizes the lecture transcript into five logical sections:

Introduction

Literature Review

Methodology

Results and Discussion

Conclusion

Inserts relevant formulas (e.g., STFT, CNN operations, PSO equations) into the presentation.

Generates a PowerPoint (.pptx) file with visually appealing slides suitable for academic presentations.

## Installation
Requirements
Python Version: Python 3.8 or higher

Dependencies:

pdfminer.six (for PDF parsing)

python-docx (for DOCX file generation)

python-pptx (for PPTX file creation)

Pillow (for image processing)

nltk (for natural language processing and summarization)

pandas (for handling table data)

Installing Dependencies
Clone the repository and install the required packages using pip:

bash
'''
    Copy
    Edit
    git clone https://github.com/snjugunanjenga/extract-PDF-word-pptx.git
    cd your-project
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## How It Works
1. PDF Extraction to DOCX Conversion
Extraction Process:

The extract_pdf.py script reads a PDF file using pdfminer.six.

Text Extraction:
Converts the PDF’s textual content into plain text.

Image Extraction:
Utilizes Pillow to extract and save any embedded images.

Table Extraction:
Detects tables within the PDF and converts them into Pandas DataFrames, which are then inserted into the DOCX file with appropriate formatting.

DOCX Creation:

The script leverages python-docx to structure the extracted content.

The resulting DOCX file maintains the original document’s structure, enhancing readability and future editing.

## 2. Lecture Summarization & PPTX Generation
Summarization & Lecture Transcript:

The generate_lecture.py script employs NLP techniques (using nltk or similar libraries) to parse the extracted DOCX content.

The content is condensed into a 10-minute lecture transcript with a clear division into the following sections:

Introduction: Context on cardiovascular challenges and the motivation for Deep Learning-based diagnosis.

Literature Review: Overview of previous work on PCG classification and feature extraction methods.

Methodology: Detailed explanation of data pre-processing (e.g., Butterworth filter, STFT) and deep learning models, including formulas.


## Results and Discussion: 
Comparison of performance metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score) for different deep learning models.

## Conclusion: 
Key takeaways, future work, and the impact of the research.

PPTX Generation:

Using the python-pptx library, the script automatically creates a PowerPoint presentation.

Each slide corresponds to one section of the lecture transcript, including bullet points, formulas (using equation images or formatted text), and any extracted figures or images.

The final presentation is designed to be both visually engaging and technically rigorous.

## Usage
Step 1: Extracting Content from a PDF
Run the following command to extract content from a PDF and generate a DOCX file:

bash
''' 

    Copy
    Edit
    python extract_pdf.py --input path/to/input.pdf --output path/to/output.docx

# Step 2: Generating a Lecture Presentation
After creating the DOCX file, run the summarization and PPTX generation script:

bash
'''
    Copy
    Edit
    python generate_lecture.py --input path/to/output.docx --topic "Deep Learning" --output path/to/lecture.pptx
# Command-Line Arguments
--input: Path to the input file (PDF for extraction, DOCX for lecture generation).

--output: Desired path for the output file (DOCX for extraction, PPTX for presentation).

--topic: (For lecture generation) The key topic for which the lecture is to be summarized and generated.
